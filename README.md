# Advanced-Computer-Networks-Multicriteria-Evaluation-Opportunistic-Routing-Protocols-Medical-Emergency-One-simulator 

**Overview**
This project evaluates Epidemic and Spray-and-Wait routing protocols in a medical emergency scenario using the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. The goal is to understand trade-offs across delivery, delay, overhead, drops, and hop count when connectivity is intermittent (DTN/Opportunistic networks).
